## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab  6, part 1:
I enjoyed lab 6, part 1 not because of the code itself but just the simple fact that I love sandwiches and I happen to eat a lot of them. Aside from me enjoying sandwiches it was straightforward to write a program which was refreshing for a first time coder like myself. 

* Lab 7, part 2: 
Lab 7, part 2 was another one of my favorites. I especially liked it because I felt that everything tied together nicely. Blackjack showed up in the homework and lecture before the lab. Which meant that going into the lab I felt I had a good understanding of how the game worked in order to put it into code. 

* Lab 10, part 1: 
Lab 10, part 1 was an interesting one. I think the reason I enjoyed  it was because it forced me to get better with the bool operator. Before this lab I wasn't very confident with bool. The whole point of labs is to go hands-on and learn so I think in that aspect it really pushed me out of my comfort zone.
